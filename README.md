This website for KASCON 29 was created using Bootstrap v4 by Kevin Lee. Last updated December 31, 2017.

### Frameworks and technologies used

* [smoothscroll.js](https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll "smoothscroll.js")

### Necessary To-Do
* Better button for registration (same format as others)? Change the font to Avenir
* The font is kinda small for big screens - up the size?
* Space out the sponsorship buttons
* Revamp hotel section and add actual content
* Make sponsorship buttons more mobile-compatible
